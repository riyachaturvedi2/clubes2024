## Data Excercise: Green House Gas Emissions & Income 
In this excercise we will explore the relationship between a country' income level and GHG emissions by creating a bar graph, through this we will test the Kuznet Curve
theory that we studied in class. 

Step 1. Loading packages and files

```{r}
library(tidyverse)   ##to be run each time you expect to use tidyverse
ghg_income <- read.csv("C:/Users/Riya/Desktop/iNPER Mexico Internship/GHG_Income_Data.csv")
```

Our dataset has several missing values- how do we deal with this? 

Step 2. Methods of removing NA values
```{r}
## Here, we are removing all NA values from the relevant only using Base R
mean(ghg_income$Total_GHG, na.rm = TRUE)

ghg_income1 <- na.omit(ghg_income)  ## through this, we can remove all NA values from the entire dataset

## Bonus: Creating a subset in Base R 
middle_income <- ghg_income1[ghg_income1$WB_IncomeLevel == "Middle Income", ]

# Creating a subset in Tidyverse & removing NA values
middle_income <- ghg_income %>% 
  filter(WB_IncomeLevel == "Middle Income" & !is.na(WB_IncomeLevel))


Now that we have cleaned data, we can work on creating our plot

```{r} 
options(scipen = 999)   ##good to run this since GHG emissions data number are very large and R abbreviates them in exponential form 

ggplot(ghg_income1, aes(x = Total_GHG, y = WB_IncomeLevel)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "pink") +                            ## yo can customise colors and palettes in this line
  labs(title = "Green House Gas Emissions (tonnes) by Income Level",
       x = "GHGs (tonnes)",
       y = "World Bank Income Level") +
  theme_minimal()                         ## R will clean up formatting and keep the aesthetic minimalist when we use this                  
```
